	abstract = {An attempt was made to examine thermal effects as well as fade and wear characteristics of rubber-based friction materials (RBFMs). A series of RBFMs with and without fiber reinforcements were prepared. The fiber reinforcements used were carbon fiber, cellulose fiber and aramid pulp. A semi-empirical model describing the correlation of coefficient of friction (COF) and temperature was presented. The effectiveness of the model was evaluated using the experimental data. The results revealed that the model parameters for a given composite show a significant change above a critical sliding velocity, i.e. 300 rpm. This behavior was speculated to be due to the transition of rubbery state of the matrix to glassy behavior caused by the viscoelastic response of the RBFMs. The experimental data revealed that such rubber-to-glass transition influences significantly the fade behavior and wear rate of the RBFMs. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The tribological contact in automotive brakes involves dry sliding contact at high speeds and high contact forces. The commonly used organic binder-type brake pad friction materials are extremely inhomogeneous and exhibit very low bulk strengths. Despite the low strength, the specific contact surfaces that form during the use render the pads very good friction and wear characteristics. This paper gives a general view of the contact situation of organic binder brake friction materials against cast iron discs, with special emphasis on many mechanisms for contact surface variations and the corresponding variations of the coefficient of friction. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

	abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

	abstract = {Overview
This repository is designed to model and calculate the temperature of railway brake discs using the Finite Element Method (FEM). The model incorporates heat transfer and elasticity equations to predict both temperature distribution and deformation in the brake disc during operation.

Methodology
The solution is based on the FEniCSx framework, which enables the efficient computation of coupled thermal and mechanical problems using FEM. This tool provides a powerful platform for solving complex partial differential equations, making it ideal for simulating the thermal and structural response of railway brake discs under operational loads.
